## Hii My name is Jardiel

- I used to work as a Telecommunication Engineer
- I started to work with computer network, dealing with MPLS tecnology applied into a Energy Company Environment
- I started to program a new monitoring platform
- This platform used Nagios as the core monitoring system
- After that, I realised I was ejoying much more to program than to work with Telecommunication related things
- I decided, then, to move on and start with something that made me more happy working with
- I am currently learning Python, Django, Ruby on Rails, HTML, Javascript, CSS
- I have a solid understanding on computer network.
